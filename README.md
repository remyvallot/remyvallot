# Hi, I'm Rémy 👋  

🎓 PhD Candidate (CIFRE) — *Applied Mathematics & Scientific Computing*  
📍 Thesis: **Convergence acceleration of nonlinear solver through physics-informed statistical learning**  

---

### 🔎 Research Focus

My work explores strategies to speed up simulations of complex physical systems by combining:  
- ⚡ **Model Order Reduction (POD, ROMs)**  
- 🧠 **Data-driven Methods (Neural Operators, PINNs)**  
- 🎯 **Convergence Acceleration & Initialization Strategies**  
- 📊 **Uncertainty Quantification**
